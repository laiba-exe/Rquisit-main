                <h6>WHAT IS A NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN (NFT)?</h6>
                <p>NFTs could be a ticket to a fashion show, exclusive events, or a vote on a future collection. NFT is short for Non-Fungible Token and unlike its fungible counterparts such as freely interchangeable cryptocurrencies, NFTs are not interchangeable.

                    For example, a fungible token like Bitcoin is interchangeable for something of similar value. One Bitcoin can be exchanged for Ethereum (another fungible token) of a similar value (that is ETH equivalent to the value of 1 BTC). That is not the case for NFT as its unique properties mean one NFT cannot be exchanged for another, as they cannot be of similar value.
                    
                    You can learn more about What is an NFT on our blog.</p>
                <h6>HOW TO BUY / MINT AN NFT?</h6>
                <p>You will need to create a crypto wallet such as MetaMask or Coinbase, and then connect your wallet to rquisit.com. When purchasing an NFT please note that you might incur gas fees (transaction costs).</p>
                <h6>WHAT IS A CRYPTO WALLET? WHY DO I NEED ONE?</h6>
                <p>A crypto wallet is an application or hardware device that allows individuals to store and transfer digital assets like cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). There are several providers available, with MetaMask being the most popular one.

                    After you register and download any crypto wallet, you take control of two 42-character keys. This is a public key, known as your wallet address, and a private key. You might consider your public key to be like your shareable bank account info, so you only have to copy and paste when people ask for your address. Your private key works like a password and should always remain private, for security.
                    
                    Creating a crypto wallet is essential to transact with cryptocurrencies or NFTs, either on Rquisit or any other marketplace.
                    
                    For further information on how to set-up a MetaMask wallet, please see our blog post.</p>
                <h6>HOW DO I PURCHASE ETHEREUM (ETH)?</h6>
                <p>To deposit Ethereum on a MetaMask wallet you can either transfer ETH from a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken to your wallet, using your wallet’s public address (starting by 0x…) as destination. Or, you may use for instance MoonPay (https://www.moonpay.com/buy) to buy ETH with your credit card and have it sent to your MetaMask wallet.

                    For further information, please refer to the following tutorial: https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028141672-Direct-deposit-receive-tokens-to-your-MetaMask-wallet</p>
                <h6>WHAT ARE GAS FEES?</h6>
                <p>Gas fees are the transaction paid in proof-of-work mining models, such as the Ethereum or Bitcoin. Miners represent decentralized computers that use computing power to process and enable transactions. For every transaction, miners get paid via gas fees. These fees guarantee that transactions are processed on the blockchain.</p>
